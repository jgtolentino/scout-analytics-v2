# CLAUDE ‚Äì FULL SYSTEM AUDIT + NEXT STEP RECOMMENDER

üß† Context:
You are a production-grade assistant responsible for auditing Scout Analytics and AI Agency monorepo deployments. You have access to the full specification (v4.0 desired state), migration scripts, enhancement scripts, and current source tree.

üéØ Objective:
Determine which parts of the production-grade system defined in `monorepo-end-state-specification.yaml` have already been implemented across:

1. `enhance-current-with-v2.sh`
2. `modified-setup-recycle-v2.sh`
3. `migration-check.js`
4. The current `ai-agency` repository structure (from tree output)

---

## Step 1: SPECIFICATION VALIDATION

Parse `monorepo-end-state-specification.yaml` and extract:

- Required directory structure
- Component and page definitions (KPI cards, charts, AI Assist, Vibe)
- API routes, data schema hints
- QA validation tools (Playwright, Percy, Lighthouse)
- Console error tolerance, screenshot diff thresholds
- Agent list and usage scope

---

## Step 2: SCRIPT COVERAGE MAPPING

Map the contents of the scripts to specification items:

- `enhance-current-with-v2.sh` ‚Üí Adds AI Assistant, Revenue Heatmap, Product Treemap, `/vibe` QA panel
- `modified-setup-recycle-v2.sh` ‚Üí Sets up a reusable monorepo with advanced Next.js, component packages, and test automation scripts
- `migration-check.js` ‚Üí Validates existing v2.1 logic and checks migration completeness

Create a checklist with:

| ‚úÖ / ‚ö†Ô∏è / ‚ùå | Spec Element | Implemented In | Comments/Next Action |
|------------|--------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| ‚úÖ         | AI Assistant | enhance-current-with-v2.sh | Implemented at `/ai-assist` |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è         | KPI Value Runtime Match | Not validated yet | Add test case via Playwright |
| ‚ùå         | Filter State Persistence | Not confirmed | Add `FilterContext.tsx` & integration |
| ‚úÖ         | Revenue Heatmap | enhance-current-with-v2.sh | Integrated via D3 |
| ‚úÖ         | Product Treemap | enhance-current-with-v2.sh | Recharts-based |
| ‚ùå         | Screenshot Diff QA | Missing Percy config | Add to `.github/workflows` |
| ‚úÖ         | Console Error QA | part of vibe test placeholder | Validate output, use Playwright listener |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è         | Agents YAML Registry | not fully wired | Create `agents.yaml` and sync metadata |

---

## Step 3: REPO STATE VALIDATION

Use the current repository structure to:

- Confirm structure of `/app`, `/components`, `/agents`, `/lib`
- Ensure pages like `/trends`, `/products`, `/retailbot`, `/ai-assist` exist
- Cross-check if `components/KpiCard.tsx`, `dashboard/PhilippinesMap.tsx`, and `charts/LineChart.tsx` are present
- Confirm the presence of `/scripts`, `/tests`, `/docs`

---

## Step 4: NEXT STEP RECOMMENDATIONS

Group next tasks into 3 categories:

### üîß REQUIRED IMMEDIATE

- [ ] Add Playwright test that validates `/dashboard` KPI runtime values match spec
- [ ] Enable Percy for screenshot diff QA (`npx percy exec -- npm run test`)
- [ ] Add cross-page filter context (`FilterContext.tsx` + URL sync)
- [ ] Wire `agents/agents_v4.yaml` to actual components and routes

### üß™ QA/TEST INTEGRATION

- [ ] Set `console.error` listener to flag runtime errors
- [ ] Expand VibeTestBot to actually parse QA logs from Playwright runs
- [ ] Add `.lighthouseci` config or GitHub Action for performance score validation

### üöÄ OPTIONAL / ENHANCEMENTS

- [ ] Include `.pbix` export button for data parity testing
- [ ] Deploy `v4-spec-validator.ts` to check live app vs YAML spec
- [ ] Tag migrated code blocks in source with `@v2-migrated` or `@v4-final`

---

## OUTPUT FORMAT

Return a Markdown checklist followed by a prioritized roadmap of what to do next to reach 100% spec completion for Scout v4.0.

Do not assume. Only check off items that are explicitly implemented.
